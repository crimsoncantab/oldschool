                </div>
                <p>I used the starter code from assignment 8 to begin my project.
                I wanted to see the effects that reflection and refraction would have
                on a model like the bunny, and I also wanted to utilize the
                arcball interface.  I added a sphere as somewhat of a control
                shape to test the mapping and shading code.</p>
                <p>My first efforts were to get an environment map working.  I
                mostly referred to the OpenGL Programming Guide
                for help on this.  I used a cube map texture to stores the environment
                of the sphere/bunny.  This required me to make six calls to
                <span class="code">glTexImage2D</span> for the positive/negative x, y and z directions.
                I first just used an image file, mountain.ppm, as the pixel data for each call,
                resulting in these two images.  The fragment shader that I used
                directly sets <span class="code">gl_FragColor</span> to a call to
                <span class="code">textureCube()</span>, passing in the
                <span class="code">samplerCube</span> and the normal vector.  GL
                does the hard work, using the vector to lookup the correct spot 
                on the cube.  Here, since I just passed in the normal, the texture is
                basically "pasted" right on to the object.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">

                <h3>Environment snapshots</h3>
                <div class="picr">
                    <img width ="256" alt="Environment Map Testing" src="./mapbad.jpg"/>
                    <div>Figure 4</div>
                </div>
                <div class="picr">
                    <img width ="256" alt="Environment Map Testing" src="./mapgood.jpg"/>
                    <div>Figure 3</div>
                </div>
                <p>Next, I wanted the environment map to actually contain a snapshot
                of the environment, so I set about writing code to draw the scene
                six times, using the object as the camera.  I also did not want the
                map to be static, so I called the snapshot code on every redisplay.
                I was worried that it would cause a significant performance hit, but
                didn't notice any slowdown unless I made the texture size really large.
                The book mentioned that each snapsnot had to be a 90-degree field-of-view,
                so I got my projection matrix from
                <span class="code">Matrix4::makeProjection(90.0,1, frust_near, frust_far)</span>.
                I also changed the viewport size to match the dimensions of the 
                texture cube.  I drew the scene, then read the color buffer into
                a pointer with <span class="code">glReadPixels()</span> which I 
                passed to <span class="code">glTexImage2D()</span>.
                The tricky part was making sure I had all sides of the cube
                oriented correctly (see fig. 4), which took a little bit of
                experimenting.  Also, I decided to use specular shading
                when drawing the environment, but kept the fragment shader for the
                sphere/bunny the same to help with orienting each side correctly.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <div class="picr">
                    <img width ="256" alt="Environment Map Testing" src="./reflection.jpg"/>
                    <div>Figure 5</div>
                </div>
                <p>After getting the environment mapping correctly set up, most
                of my remaining code changes happened in the shaders.  Getting
                reflection to work was relatively easy. I added
                the location of the camera as a uniform variable, and calculated
                the bounce vector using a vector to the camera and the normal
                with the same equation that we implemented in the raytracer.
                This is what I passed to <span class="code">textureCube()</span>.
                Figure 5 shows the bunny using this shader (part specular shading,
                part reflection-This allows the edges of the bunny to be visible,
                and opposed to Figs. 3 and 4).  One thing to note about
                this image is that, since <span class="code">textureCube()</span>
                acts like the vector is coming straight from the center of the object,
                some of the points on the bunny don't match up with real life or
                a raytracer.  This leads to artifacts like the repetion of the cubes over the bunny's,
                surface; any points on the bunny with the same normal will reflect
                the same point in the environment. Also, especially around the front
                paws of the bunny, it becomes apparent that there is only one level
                of reflection.  The bunny doesn't block light from itself, so concave
                sections will seem less realistic.  On the bright side, it renders
                quite easily in real time.

                <h3>Refraction</h3>
                <div class="picl">
                    <img width ="256" alt="Environment Map Testing" src="./refraction.jpg"/>
                    <div>Figure 6</div>
                </div>
                <p>Refraction, also, took only a bit of coding in the fragment
                shader.  I used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell's_law">Wikipedia</a>
                as a reference to write my code.  The most difficult part here was
                deriving the math needed to get the refraction vector using Snell's
                Law, and the Wikipedia article gave me the information I needed.  I only
                use one level of refraction, so with the sphere, for example, it acts
                more as a convex lense than an actual clear marble would look like.</p>

                <h3>Running the Program</h3>
                <p>I did my development on a 64-bit Windows 7 under Visual Studio.
                When running the program, these are the controls:
                <br/>Left Mouse - Rotate (uses invisible arcball)
                <br/>Right Mouse - Translate X and Y
                <br/>Left+Right/Middle Mouse - Translate Z
                <br/>o - switch between moving camera and object
                <br/>space - switch between bunny and sphere
                <br/>s - cycle through shading programs
                <br/>w - take a snapshot
                <br/>m - switch world/skycam mode
                </p>
