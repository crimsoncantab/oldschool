How to specify rules
- All rules must go in rules.txt
- Have 1 rule per line
- Format of a rule is: "Field" "Text"
  so field can be Subject, Body, or To.
  These rules should be specified with a capital first letter, and be all one
  word (naturally, for these tags!).

How to run the program - and test that it performs as expected
- We have included the files in.mbox, out.mbox, and rules.txt
- When you run the Makefile, the executable spamfilter is produced
- in.mbox has 3 messages, the middle of which should be filtered out as spam
  according to our rules.txt
- So you can run "spamfilter in.mbox out.mbox rules.txt", and out.mbox will
  contain a filtered version of in.mbox - it will only have the 2 clean
  messages in it.
