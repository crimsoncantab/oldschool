CS51 Assignment 7 Design Review

1. The filter functionality in our spam filter was coded in a class of it's own,
called Filter. If we had implemented the filtering with our Rule class, it would
make it possible to have one rule filter through the entire mailbox easily, by
simply passing it the mailbox and having it remove the messages that violate
that rule.  If the filter was implemented in the message objects, creating a new
mbox file is more straitforward, as the mailbox simply has to apply the list
of rules to its messages and remove the spam.  However, when the filter is
implemented as a separate class, it becomes easy to extend it so that more than
one mbox file can be created, such as a spam mbox.

2. One primary weakness that I found in our design was the manner in which we
stored the rules that the spamfilter imported every time it ran.  With the 
system we used, it is hard to extend it to use more advanced rules that do more
than pattern matching.  Another weakness came with the MailMessage class, where
we had to store both the message itself and all of its fields in two separate
objects.  If we had created more functions that allowed us to manipulate the
data in a MailMessage better, we would have a more powerful and efficient
implementation.
