==================

For this assignment, we have proided some tests to demonstrate that our code
runs correctly. We have some code in tests.scm, and expected output in
expected_out.txt and expected_err.txt (output and errors). 

We have written a script called 'tests' which runs tests.scm through rpl and
outputs any differences between actual and expected output.

We also have a script called perm, which is purely for internal use (getting
permissions on files correct so that both of us could work on code together).
