Qustion 1:
i. The number of colors for each file type: BMP - 2^24, JPG - 2^24, GIF - 256
ii. GIF supports animations
iii. Lossless compression does not change the quality of an image at all.  Lossy 
does to an extent, depending on how great of a compression is desired.  Lossy 
trades quality for memory.
iv. JPEGs use lossy format.

Question 2:
i. When a file is deleted, only the pointer to the file is removed, not the 
actual data in the file.
ii. The drive can either be destroyed or degaussed (the first of which obviously 
makes the drive unusuable, the second of which will probably do so as well).  To 
keep the drive usable, it can be rewritten over with random values for each 
byte, but that doesn't guarantee that the data on the drive cannot be recovered
