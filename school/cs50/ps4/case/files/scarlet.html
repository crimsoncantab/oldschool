<P ALIGN="CENTER">BEING A REPRINT FROM THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN H. WATSON,
M.D., LATE OF THE ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT</P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Chapter 1</H4>
<H5 ALIGN="CENTER">MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES</H5>
<P>IN THE YEAR 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of
London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons
in the Army.  Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as assistant surgeon.  The regiment was stationed
in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had
broken out.  On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through
the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country.  I followed, however,
with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded
in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered
upon my new duties.</P>
<P>The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
nothing but misfortune and disaster.  I was removed from my brigade and attached
to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand.  There I
was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and
grazed the subclavian artery.  I should have fallen into the hands of the
murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray,
my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me
safely to the British lines.</P>
<P>Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone,
I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at
Peshawar.  Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk
about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the veranda, when I was struck
down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions.  For months my life
was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I
was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should
be lost in sending me back to England.  I was despatched, accordingly, in the
troopship Orontes, and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health
irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend
the next nine months in attempting to improve it.</P>
<P>I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air-or
as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to
be.  Under such circumstances I naturally gravitated to London, that great
cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly
drained.  There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading
a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had,
considerably more freely than I ought.  So alarming did the state of my finances
become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and
rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in
my style of living.  Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my
mind to leave the hotel, and take up my quarters in some less pretentious and
less expensive domicile.</P>
<P>On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the
Criterion Bar, when someone tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round I
recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Bart's.  The sight
of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed
to a lonely man.  In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of
mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be
delighted to see me.  In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me
at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.</P>
<P>&quot;Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?&quot; he asked in
undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.  &quot;You
are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.&quot;</P>
<P>I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by
the time that we reached our destination.</P>
<P>&quot;Poor devil!&quot; he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to
my misfortunes.  &quot;What are you up to now?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Looking for lodgings,&quot; I answered.  &quot;Trying to solve the
problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable
price.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That's a strange thing,&quot; remarked my companion; &quot;you are the
second man to-day that has used that expression to me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And who was the first?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P>&quot;A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.
 He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone to go
halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which were too much
for his purse.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By Jove!&quot; I cried; &quot;if he really wants someone to share the
rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him.  I should prefer having a
partner to being alone.&quot;</P>
<P>Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wineglass.  &quot;You
don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,&quot; he said; &quot;perhaps you would not care
for him as a constant companion.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, what is there against him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him.  He is a little queer
in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science.  As far as I know he is
a decent fellow enough.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A medical student, I suppose?&quot; said I.</P>
<P>&quot;No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for.  I believe he is well
up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he has
never taken out any systematic medical classes.  His studies are very desultory
and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the-way knowledge which would
astonish his professors.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you never ask him what he was going in for?&quot; I asked.</P>
<P>&quot;No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be
communicative enough when the fancy seizes him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should like to meet him,&quot; I said.  &quot;If I am to lodge with
anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits.  I am not strong
enough yet to stand much noise or excitement.  I had enough of both in
Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence.  How could I
meet this friend of yours?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He is sure to be at the laboratory,&quot; returned my companion.  &quot;He
either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning till
night.  If you like, we will drive round together after luncheon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly,&quot; I answered, and the conversation drifted away into
other channels.</P>
<P>As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave
me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a
fellow-lodger.</P>
<P>&quot;You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,&quot; he said; &quot;I
know nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in
the laboratory.  You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me
responsible.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,&quot; I answered. 
&quot;It seems to me, Stamford,&quot; I added, looking hard at my companion, &quot;that
you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter.  Is this fellow's
temper so formidable, or what is it?  Don't be mealymouthed about it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not easy to express the inexpressible,&quot; he answered with a
laugh. &quot;Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to
cold-bloodedness.  I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of the
latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply
out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects.  To
do him justice, I think that he would take it himself with the same readiness.
He appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very right too.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, but it may be pushed to excess.  When it comes to beating the
subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a
bizarre shape.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Beating the subjects!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death.  I saw him
at it with my own eyes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And yet you say he is not a medical student?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No.  Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are.  But here we
are, and you must form your own impressions about him.&quot;  As he spoke, we
turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened
into a wing of the great hospital.  It was familiar ground to me, and I needed
no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the
long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors.  Near
the farther end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the
chemical laboratory.</P>
<P>This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.</P>
<P>Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,
test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.  There
was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed
in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round and sprang to his feet
with a cry of pleasure.  &quot;I've found it!  I've found it,&quot; he shouted
to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his hand.  &quot;I have
found a re-agent which is precipitated by haemoglobin, and by nothing else.&quot;
 Had he discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his
features.</P>
<P>&quot;Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,&quot; said Stamford, introducing us.</P>
<P>&quot;How are you?&quot; he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength
for which I should hardly have given him credit.  &quot;You have been in
Afghanistan, I perceive.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How on earth did you know that?&quot; I asked in astonishment.</P>
<P>&quot;Never mind,&quot; said he, chuckling to himself.  &quot;The question
now is about haemoglobin.  No doubt you see the significance of this discovery
of mine?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,&quot; I answered, &quot;but
practically-- --&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains?  Come over
here now!&quot;  He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and drew me
over to the table at which he had been working.  &quot;Let us have some fresh
blood,&quot; he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the
resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.  &quot;Now, I add this small
quantity of blood to a litre of water.  You perceive that the resulting mixture
has the appearance of pure water.  The proportion of blood cannot be more than
one in a million.  I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the
characteristic reaction.&quot;  As he spoke, he threw into the vessel a few
white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid.  In an instant
the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was
precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.</P>
<P>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted
as a child with a new toy.  &quot;What do you think of that?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It seems to be a very delicate test,&quot; I remarked.</P>
<P>&quot;Beautiful! beautiful!  The old guaiacum test was very clumsy and
uncertain.  So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.  The latter
is valueless if the stains are a few hours old.  Now, this appears to act as
well whether the blood is old or new.  Had this test been invented, there are
hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty
of their crimes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed!&quot; I murmured.</P>
<P>&quot;Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point.  A man is
suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed.  His linen or
clothes are examined and brownish stains discovered upon them.  Are they blood
stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they?  That
is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why?  Because there was no
reliable test.  Now we have the Sherlock Holmes's test, and there will no longer
be any difficulty.&quot;</P>
<P>His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his heart
and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his imagination.</P>
<P>&quot;You are to be congratulated,&quot; I remarked, considerably surprised
at his enthusiasm.</P>
<P>&quot;There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year.  He would
certainly have been hung had this test been in existence.  Then there was Mason
of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of
New Orleans.  I could name a score of cases in which it would have been
decisive.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,&quot; said Stamford with a
laugh. &quot;You might start a paper on those lines.  Call it the 'Police News
of the Past.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very interesting reading it might be made, too,&quot; remarked
Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.
 &quot;I have to be careful,&quot; he continued, turning to me with a smile, &quot;for
I dabble with poisons a good deal.&quot;  He held out his hand as he spoke, and
I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and
discoloured with strong acids.</P>
<P>&quot;We came here on business,&quot; said Stamford, sitting down on a high
three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his foot.  &quot;My
friend here wants to take diggings; and as you were complaining that you could
get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you
together.&quot;</P>
<P>Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with me. &quot;I
have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,&quot; he said, &quot;which would suit us
down to the ground.  You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I always smoke 'ship's' myself,&quot; I answered.</P>
<P>&quot;That's good enough.  I generally have chemicals about, and
occasionally do experiments.  Would that annoy you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;By no means.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let me see--what are my other shortcomings?  I get in the dumps at
times, and don't open my mouth for days on end.  You must not think I am sulky
when I do that.  Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right.  What have you to
confess now?  It's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another
before they begin to live together.&quot;</P>
<P>I laughed at this cross-examination.  &quot;I keep a bull pup,&quot; I said,
&quot;and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all
sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy.  I have another set of vices
when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Do you include violin playing in your category of rows?&quot; he
asked, anxiously.</P>
<P>&quot;It depends on the player,&quot; I answered.  &quot;A well-played
violin is a treat for the gods--a badly played one-- --&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, that's all right,&quot; he cried, with a merry laugh.  &quot;I
think we may consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable
to you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When shall we see them?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle
everything,&quot; he answered.</P>
<P>&quot;All right--noon exactly,&quot; said I, shaking his hand.</P>
<P>We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards my
hotel.</P>
<P>&quot;By the way,&quot; I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon
Stamford, &quot;how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?&quot;</P>
<P>My companion smiled an enigmatical smile.  &quot;That's just his little
peculiarity,&quot; he said.  &quot;A good many people have wanted to know how he
finds things out.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! a mystery is it?&quot; I cried, rubbing my hands.  &quot;This is
very piquant.</P>
<P>I am much obliged to you for bringing us together.  'The proper study of
mankind is man,' you know.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You must study him, then,&quot; Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.
 &quot;You'll find him a knotty problem, though.  I'll wager he learns more
about you than you about him.  Good-bye.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably
interested in my new acquaintance.</P>
