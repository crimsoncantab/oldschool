<h2>Down the Rabbit-Hole</h2>

<p class="firstparagraph">Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into
the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or
conversations in it, &#8220;and what is the use of a book,&#8221; thought Alice,
"without pictures or conversations?&#8221;</p>

<p>So she was considering, in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of
making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.</p>

<p>There was nothing so <em>very</em> remarkable in that; nor did Alice think
it so <em>very</em> much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, &#8220;Oh
dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!&#8221; (when she thought it over
afterward, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this,
but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but, when the Rabbit
actually <em>took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket</em>, and looked at it,
and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across
her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and, burning with
curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to
see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>

<p>In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how
in the world she was to get out again.</p>

<p>The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then
dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think
about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what
seemed to be a very deep well.</p>

<p>Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had
plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder what
was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out
what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything: then she
looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled
with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there she saw maps and
pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves
as she passed: it was labeled &#8220;ORANGE MARMALADE,&#8221; but to her great
disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for
fear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of
the cupboards as she fell past it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; thought Alice to herself. &#8220;After such a fall as this, I shall
think nothing of tumbling downstairs! How brave they&#8217;ll all think me
at home! Why, I wouldn&#8217;t say anything about it, even if I fell off the
top of the house!&#8221; (Which was very likely true.)</p>

<p>Down, down, down. Would the fall <em>never</em> come to an end? &#8220;I wonder how
many miles I&#8217;ve fallen by this time?&#8221; she said aloud. &#8220;I must be
getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would
be four thousand miles down, I think&#151;&#8221; (for, you see, Alice had
learned several things of this sort in her lessons in the school-room,
and though this was not a <em>very</em> good opportunity for showing off her
knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good
practice to say it over) &#8220;&#151;yes, that&#8217;s about the right distance&#151;but
then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I&#8217;ve got to?&#8221; (Alice had not
the slightest idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but she
thought they were nice grand words to say).</p>

<p>Presently she began again. &#8220;I wonder if I shall fall right <em>through</em>
the earth! How funny it&#8217;ll seem to come out among the people that walk
with their heads downward! The antipathies, I think&#151;&#8221; (she was rather
glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn&#8217;t sound at all
the right word) &#8220;&#151;but I shall have to ask them what the name of the
country is, you know. Please, Ma&#8217;am, is this New Zealand? Or
Australia?&#8221; (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke&#151;fancy, <em>curtseying</em>
as you&#8217;re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?)
"And what an ignorant little girl she&#8217;ll think me for asking! No,
it&#8217;ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began
talking again. &#8220;Dinah&#8217;ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!"
(Dinah was the cat.) &#8220;I hope they&#8217;ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. Dinah, my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are
no mice in the air, I&#8217;m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that&#8217;s
very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?&#8221; And here
Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a
dreamy sort of way, &#8220;Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?&#8221; and
sometimes, &#8220;Do bats eat cats?&#8221; for, you see, as she couldn&#8217;t answer
either question, it didn&#8217;t much matter which way she put it. She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was
walking hand in hand with Dinah, and was saying to her, very
earnestly, &#8220;Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?"
when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and
dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p>

<p>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead: before her was
another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight,
hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice
like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a
corner, &#8220;Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it&#8217;s getting!&#8221; She was
close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no
longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was
lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.</p>

<p>There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and
when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying
every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was
ever to get out again.</p>

<p>Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid
glass: there was nothing on it but a tiny golden key, and Alice&#8217;s
first idea was that this might belong to one of the doors of the hall;
but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,
but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second
time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before,
and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried
the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p>

<p>Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not
much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the
passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get
out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright
flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head
through the doorway; &#8220;and even if my head <em>would</em> go through,&#8221; thought
poor Alice, &#8220;it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,
how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I
only knew how to begin.&#8221; For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible.</p>

<p><img src="/files/alice-in-wonderland/oh-dear.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went
back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at
any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this
time she found a little bottle on it ("which certainly was not here
before,&#8221; said Alice), and tied round the neck of the bottle was a
paper label, with the words &#8220;DRINK ME&#8221; beautifully printed on it in
large letters.</p>

<p>It was all very well to say &#8220;Drink me,&#8221; but the wise little Alice was
not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. &#8220;No, I&#8217;ll look first,&#8221; she said,
"and see whether it&#8217;s marked &#8217;<em>poison</em>&#8217; or not"; for she had read
several nice little stories about children who had got burned, and
eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, all because they
<em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:
such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;
and that, if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually
bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a
bottle marked &#8220;poison,&#8221; it is almost certain to disagree with you,
sooner or later.</p>

<p>However, this bottle was <em>not</em> marked &#8220;poison,&#8221; so Alice ventured
to taste it, and, finding it very nice (it had, in fact, a sort of
mixed flavor of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy,
and hot buttered toast), she very soon finished it off.</p>

<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&#8220;What a curious feeling!&#8221; said Alice. &#8220;I must be shutting up like a
telescope!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face
brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going
through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she
waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any
further: she felt a little nervous about this; &#8220;for it might end, you
know,&#8221; said Alice to herself, &#8220;in my going out altogether, like a
candle. I wonder what I should be like then?&#8221; And she tried to fancy
what the flame of a candle looks like after the candle is blown out,
for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.</p>

<p>After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on
going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got
to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and
when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not
possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass,
and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but
it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying,
the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, there&#8217;s no use in crying like that!&#8221; said Alice to herself
rather sharply. &#8220;I advise you to leave off this minute!&#8221; She generally
gave herself very good advice (though she very seldom followed it),
and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into
her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for
having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against
herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two
people. &#8220;But it&#8217;s no use now,&#8221; thought poor Alice, &#8220;to pretend to be
two people! Why, there&#8217;s hardly enough of me left to make <em>one</em>
respectable person!&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the
table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the
words &#8220;EAT ME&#8221; were beautifully marked in currants. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll eat
it,&#8221; said Alice, &#8220;and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key;
and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door: so either
way I&#8217;ll get into the garden, and I don&#8217;t care which happens!&#8221;</p>

<p>She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, &#8220;Which way? Which
way?&#8221; holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was
growing; and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the
same size. To be sure, this is what generally happens when one eats
cake; but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but
out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid
for life to go on in the common way.</p>

<p>So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p>
