Laser printers work by melting a toner onto the paper.  A laser is guided by the 
printer's hardware to excite toner molecules on a drum and make them fall with 
precision onto the right spots of the paper to form the printed image.  The 
toner is then heated so that it melts onto the paper.  With inkjet printers, A 
printing cartridge full of ink (generally black or three colors: magenta, 
yellow, cyan) 
runs back and forth across the paper and "jets" out dots of ink (in the right 
proportion of colors, for color printing) so that the ink forms the printed 
image.
