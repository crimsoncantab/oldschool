The touchscreen of the iPhone is made up of thousands of little sensors that 
act as switches.  When a group of sensors are switched by the touch of a finger,
programming in the iPhone determines what pattern the "on" switches make.  For 
example, if two separate groups of switches are pressed simultaneously and then 
start moving toward each other (where some switches turn off, others turn on so 
that the two groups of on switches are closer) , the iPhone recognizes this as 
a "pinch" and performs the zooming operation at the location between the groups.
More generally, the iPhone recognizes a finger's movement by the pattern of 
switches being pressed and unpressed and acts accordingly.
