I implemented an O(n) version of the sort for the hacker edition (and dropped 
to regular), but for either version, the new algorithm is slower than the 
original because any sort (in the regular version's case, O(n^2) will take at 
least as long as just a linear search (O(n))
through an entire list of items, and that is added upon by the time the binary 
search (O(log(n))) takes.  Sorting before searching is useful when the list is 
going to be searched many times for different values.

i. The framework of this program allows for boards from 3x3 to 9x9 in size
ii. The board is represented by a 2-d array
iii. Unsurprisingly, greet() is called to greet the player
