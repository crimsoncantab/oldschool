i. getrusage() stores in an usuage struct information about how much of the system resources are being used by the current process or its child processes.
ii. According to gnu.org, struct rusuage has 16 members
iii. before and after are structs, so they have multiple members to refer to.  Thus, using pointers to these structs is a much easier and safer way to access their members, simply by using the "->" notation.
iv. The for loop in main loops through every character in the input file.  If the character is a letter or "'" the function adds it to char * word, as long as the word is not already 45 characters long.  If there is a number in the word, the function ignores it by iterating until it reaches the end of that word.  For any character other than numbers, letters, and "'" the function treats that as the end of the word and adds the null character to word.  It then has a char * that can be sent into the spellchecker.
v. Relying on fscanf will not get account for non-alpha characters other than the space, so words with numbers in them or other strange characters will be counted as words.  fgetc() is able to check every character to make sure it would be in a word, and thus gets rid of the extra fluff in an input file.
