Our project can be run using the following command:
"./final input/sphere0_nodes.txt input/sphere0_tris.txt"

We have built in additional features to select nodes and change the velocity of nodes by using different key combinations as described in our final paper.

brief overview:
- LEFT-RIGHT key allows you to toggle between the sphere mesh and the inner cloud mesh (index is displayed in upper left corner)
- to select nodes press "S" and then drag a box around the nodes. This will select only the nodes of the currently selected mesh 
- UP-DOWN increase and decrease the velocity of the selected nodes
