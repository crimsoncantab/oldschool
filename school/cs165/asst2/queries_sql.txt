#this query is nearly impossible with standard sql.  Standard sql,
#as far as I have been able to determine, does not offer any sort
#of functionality to concatenate strings.  Therefore, it is very
#difficult and impractical, using LIKE, to test every combination
#of fields that adds up to having at least 6 8's.  The following
#is a way to do it using MySQL's CONCAT function (which violates
#the SQL standard):
#SELECT lastname,firstname,home_phone,work_phone,address,city,state,zip,country FROM
#	(SELECT *, CONCAT(home_phone, work_phone, address, zip) AS nums FROM data) AS q
#	WHERE nums LIKE '%8%8%8%8%8%8%';
