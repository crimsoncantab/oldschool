In solving the genome problem, I would probably prefer
a relational database over a flat file.  The main reason
is size.  Having the entire genome of many species sitting
in a flat file (or possibly more than one) makes the data
extremely inaccessible.  It would take a very long time to
iterate through the entire file, which would be necessary
for any query that a unix command could do.  With a relational
database, the data can be organized in a more efficient way
and broken up into smaller pieces more easily (as opposed to hundreds
or thousands or millions of flat files), and accessing any of these
pieces can be done without processing the entire dataset.

The downside to using a relational database is the limitations
in SQL pattern matching.  This can be fixed by simply adding
an application layer of processing, which could do more
complicated data comparisons, along the capabilities
of grep or awk.

In other words, niether approach--flat file + UNIX or relational
db + SQL--can by itself meet the requirements of this data
management problem.  But a good portion of the problem, data storage
and retrieval, is more manageable with a relational database
approach.
